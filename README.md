This is my first attempt at a Flask web app using HTML, CSS, and Python. This is a blog app that requires 
 a login and allows the user to post a blog which is stored in a database.
 
 Kind of "vanilla", but it WORKS!! 
 
 Plus the fact, it was fun and very good practice!
 Keep on coding, y'all!!
